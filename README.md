Java 1.7 Features Demos
=======================

30-Mar-2012

Much of the code was gathered from Packt book: http://www.packtpub.com/java-7-new-features-cookbook

Several of the classes had to be modified to compile and some classes required modification to use Java 7 features such as multiple exceptions in catch block.

Added use of Logback and SLF4J, refactoring out most of the System.out code.

Refactored out all of the references to the Windows C: drive.
